LoRa (Long Range) communication devices are used for wireless communication over long distances with low power consumption. These devices utilize Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology to encode information on radio waves, making them suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where long-range and low-power communication are crucial.
Key Features:
•	Long Range: Capable of transmitting data over distances of several kilometers.
•	Low Power: Designed for low energy consumption, enabling battery-powered operation for extended periods.
•	CSS Technology: Uses chirp pulses to modulate data, providing robustness against interference and noise.
•	Versatile Applications: Ideal for smart cities, agriculture, industrial monitoring, and remote sensing.

LoRa communication devices offer a reliable solution for long-range, low-power wireless communication, making them integral to modern IoT systems.
